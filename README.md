Hi, I'm Luis 👋

Backend & Systems Developer · Real-Time Networking · Game Dev Mindset · AI-assisted Engineering

I build tools, system-level features and real-world workflows that people actually want to use. Simplicity, clarity, predictability — that's the kind of software I like to make.
Professional experience with EEBUS (smart home interoperability), mDNS, WebSockets and system-level testing.

From networking utilities to Unity gameplay systems and public game mods (10k+ users), I enjoy building things people can actually rely on.
